# NO:1) single quote :

print("hello bro, how are you ? ")  #This is normal but what if we want to use inverted comma for 
#                            for how . for example : hello bro, "how" are you ? 

print("hello bro, \"how\" are you ? ")  # \"\" --> this is used to show inverted comma even inside()
