# the types of datatypes in python are :
a = 4 ; # this is integer 
b = 2.2 ; # this is float datatype
c = "rajiv" # this is string datatype
d = True ; # this is boolean datatypes ( this can also be False )
e = None ; # this is None datatypes (this is used to specify that the variable 'e' has nothing)

# something most important is (not opeartor in python)
print(not(True))  # this will print false since i have used 'not' tough there is true.
print(not(False)) # this will pritn True since i have used 'not' tough there is false.
