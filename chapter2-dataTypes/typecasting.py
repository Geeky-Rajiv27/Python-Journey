# implicit type conversion and explicit are same as in other programming languages like C,C++,java etc.

# NOte : variables in  python are very smart they find out themselves that what type of data they 
# are storing . Like other programming languages we don't need to mention the datatypes for each 
# variables .

#THe way to know the type of the data is :
 
a = 5 ;
print(type(a)) # this will show <class 'int'> this is basically output since 5 is integer so the 
# type of 'a' will also be integer hence it shows <class 'int'>
